[-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitVersionStrings]
# Yes, valid reasoning, but v-strings were introduced in 5.6 in March 2000!

[-ControlStructures::ProhibitUnlessBlocks]
# I have no problem with unless.

[-Subroutines::ProhibitSubroutinePrototypes]
# Good idea, but this doesn't recognise signatures as not being prototypes.

[-ErrorHandling::RequireCarping]
# Sometimes the error is in my code...
# I don't want this to be as strict as it is. An 'allow_in_main' option would
# be good.

[-RegularExpressions::RequireDotMatchAnything]
# I don't make this mistake anymore.

[-RegularExpressions::RequireLineBoundaryMatching]
# Never been a problem that I can recall.

[-ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls]
# This is one of my favourite language features! You may not take it away!
